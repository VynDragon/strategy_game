# On the ground:

Units:
- Supply Points
- Transport Points
- Strike Points

Supply Points: Either stored via transports, or awarded based on distance to depot building or ship, counted down by every
unit on the field, serves as soft unit cap.
Transport Points: awarded based on distance to base building, can be not awarded at all if nothing is nearby.
Allows reinforcing and calling in new units. Some units maybe use supply instead of transport for reinforcing?
Strike Points: Allows calling special stuffs: airdrop behind enemy lines, orbital artillery, supply points drop, etc...

Capturable / buildable points:
- Air defenses
- Air strips
- Other local points giving supply, transport, or strike
- Victory Points

Air defenses increase supply points and transport point income for bases and depots
Air strips is where units are spawned and reinforced
Other local points: Local highway depot, Train depot, local airport, local spaceport, abandonned bunkers...
Ability to convert 'basic' area points to the other types?

Buildings:
- Base
- Depot

Base provides transport points relative to distance to fight and allows calling in reinforcement units at airstrips if in range.
Depot provides supply points relative to distance to fight.
A fight can happen out of range of both of those, in this case, stored supply is used and spawning new units is not possible.

Ship modules:
- Transport module
- Supply module

Fill the role of base and depot from orbit


### Combat flow:

Groups are formed, with a set of units, maybe some transports. Those will be the units available at the start
of a fight. They will *ALL* be spawned on the map at the start of the fight.
Units can be resting when unused so as to consume less supply, however it takes a few minutes to ready them for combat, and they are easily destroyable when disabled. This is useful when having no supply income.
Some units are 'scout' units and mostly invisible on the planetary map, all other units are visible on the planetary map within a certain range.

Types of fight:
- Skirmish: Group of units encounter other group of units (scouts or not): Everyone starts with whichever units are present, if both scout, is basically a CoH game start
- Attack/Defense: Unit group attacks defensive position, defensive position has a few minutes of play before attacker enters units, allowing to spawn new units and build/capture stuffs

Flow:
1. Fight starts
2. Capture or build airstrips, allowing to call new units
3. Capture/Build air defense and other points to increase income
4. Hold victory points, or cause enemy to surrender by depleting enemy units or supply points


# Game Conditions

~2050s
Earth is a mess of war and unrest, corporation wage war, countr wage war, freedom movements everywhere.
Suspect and incomprehensible signals are discovered in the solar system, getting stronger and stronger
Until some day, before anything is decrypted they are gone with an observable big flash of light
Months later, meteors (the safe kind) start hitting earth earth more and more often, it's linked to the flash as it follows the path an exploding object debris from the point the flash was seen
However no one cares cuz earth is a mess of war and unrest by this point
Until people look at those meteors, and find them to be obvious fragment of alien machinery
So it's a craze of gathering the fragments, which sometimes are fully or mostly functional pieces of technology
Chief among them fusion-based thrusters.


You could be a ceo of a corp, the dictator of a country, or barely organized revolutionary
And you gather the fragments
As big entity you probably gather a lot to find something you need (an engine)
As a smaller entity, you luck out and bloody fight for your engine
And that's how the game starts with shooting out into the solar system in quest for fragments that didn't land on earth or whatever else your goals (strategy game here so the goal is final domination)
On a fancy ship or whatever you crafted out
There are different artefacts, fragments, etc. but the most important are the engines of different sizes that power your early journey into space
And the rest are mostly boost to your research

So at the start of the game you have your engine and set to gain a foothold
Because whatever you are it gains you a boatload of money and interest
Allowing you to build shitty ships in orbit  very easily and setting out to conquer space

As a small entity you will likely be relegated to colonizing the asteroids and jovian moons while the prominent entities get mars and stuffs
But as a small entity you grow independent from earth and inventive while the bigger entity should tend to stagnate and earth staying a very important thing for them
Big entities get employees and functionaries while small entities get fanatics and the cream of the crop of highly motivated people and that gives different results

1. Tutorial for ground combat
So you start as a group of anarcho-communist revolutionary in Germany and fight a corp or the gouvernement because an intact engine landed in your backyard , or a corp or gov doing that like 15 times on the other side to get an engine
Then you build your ship in your besties' hidden factory or at the r&d office
(it's a shitty ass transport ship that will do ferrying anyway from earth to wherever, the engine only big enough for a small craft)

2. Tutorial for city/station building
Then go off to setup your first station
In earth orbit if you have balls and are not scared of getting shot up by ground to space shit, or further if you will not be able to defend it
And at this point everyone's transport capacity is the same, what changes is your resource income: Small entity can only expand in space, while big entity has earth income
However small entities will quickly grow new techniques, as the science and tech people joining the party at the gay space communism station are heavily motivated
While big entity have a normal rate of growth for the tech
The goal is by mid-game who has more res income should flip

3. The way to expand at first is gathering more engines, especially bigger ones that will help you build your first warships
Smaller ones expand your transport capacity, and quickly you can build ships with shitty human engines for transporting stuffs between resource gathering points and where the work is done

4. Culture drift and total domination
The core point should be significantly drift in culture between the various entities driven by the tech research decisions
So you start as Toshiba heavy industries, with your sworn enemy being Russia, and end up as kawaii cyborgs vs space bears with an accent (the space bears turned into a hivemind mid way).
I want to throw funny stuffs in the tech tree like cyborg tech, genetic modification, etc
Those will tend to show up for small entities
So you can get a slightly more expensive, but better unit of foot soldiers that are cyborg soldiers
Or have funny stuff like ship minds or city minds
Or have the gene tech and make dog girls for your Anarcho-capitalist brothels
Or the corpos replacing you with a slave race
Or maybe as  the comrade in chief character you get cyborg conversion within the first few batches, hide it because pr, and have some cyborg supra revolution and go "i've been 10 steps ahead this entire time" on the daily live stream

### Facts

You only get an equivalent to the alien fusion engines when humanity finally figures out fusion:
the alien engines are very limited in size, theorized to be landing craft engines, simple for the alien tech level, and whatever they used to get here is what blew up, likely after travelling a few thousand years with everyone onboard dead.

# Ships

2 Main types:
- Transports
- Ships

Transports are the smallest size of ships, they are not modular. They are the transport capacity between stations, depots, bases, etc... Acting like HOI4 convoys or trains, can be destroyed in similar ways by overall dedicated fleet stances that required another stance to counter it. These use the smallest size of engine, the kind you get at the start of the game and that you can build shitty inefficient versions of quickly.

### Modular Ships

Ships are your run of the mill ship, starting one size up from Transports. They use bigger engines that can only be found intact in space, or built shitty inefficient later.
They are modular on a 3d grid like stations, in which you can place engines, fuel tanks, reactors... etc...

Modules such as:

|Tier|Type|Name|Special|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shit|Power|Fuel Cells|Extremely Light, high power density, very inefficient|
|Shit|Power|Solar|Light, shit power density, infinite effiency|
|Basic|Power|Solid Fuel Fission Reactor|Basic Power Supply|
|Basic++|Power|Liquid Fuel Fission Reactor|Basic Power Supply++, more efficient and more power dense than solid fuel|
|Good|Power|Deut-Trit Fusion Reactor|Basic Power Supply for Gen 1 Torch Ships|
|Shit|Thrust|Chemical Rocket|Light, very inefficient, somewhat powerful but terrible power density|
|Basic|Thrust|Thermonuclear Rocket|Heavy, fairly efficient, not very powerful, requires Fission reactor|
|Good|Thrust|Fusion torch (closed cooling)|Heavy, efficient, somewhat powerful, requires Fusion reactor|
|Good|Thrust|Fusion torch (open cooling)|Less heavy, less efficient, more powerful, requires Fusion reactor|
|Basic|Weapon|Gunpowder gun|Basic shooty|
|Basic|Weapon|Torpedoes|Basic powered shooty|
|Basic|Weapon|Railgun|Electric shooty|
|Good|Weapon|Railgun+|Better electric shooty|
